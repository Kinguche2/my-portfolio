        <p className="a-sub">
          I am a web developer with in-depth experience in UI/UX design and
          back-end web development.
        </p>
        <p className="a-desc">
          I create websites that help organizations address business challenges
          and meet their needs. I manage everything from website navigation and
          layout to a companyâ€™s web hosting and security architecture. My
          expertise lies within back-end architecture, front-end web apps, and
          the main languages in my tech stack are JavaScript, React, Python and
          of course HTML/CSS. I am a lifelong learner (currently taking a course
          on building AI chatbots with Python!) and love to read, run, and write
          poems.
